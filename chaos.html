        <h2>FOUNDER</h2>
        <p>
            The illustrious origins of the dynasty can be traced back to the distant annals of the fourth epoch, a time shrouded in the mists of 'dark history.' The foundation of this dynasty remains a riddle, but the earliest known founder was the venerable Lie Thorne Xier. Born with an innate enlightenment that exceeded the bounds of mortal comprehension, he possessed knowledge and wisdom that eclipsed even the most erudite of his contemporaries.

            Legend whispers that Lie Thorne Xier hailed from the Moreau Dynasty, a storied lineage hailing from the northern lands, with a history stretching back to the second epoch. Once a duchy of tremendous wealth and influence, the Moreau Dynasty amassed a fortune said to rival two mountains of solid gold. However, during the early throes of the fourth epoch, calamity befell the Moreau Dynasty, as envious eyes coveted their power and affluence. They were hunted relentlessly, and many of their members fell to their pursuers. Those who survived chose to forsake their names and lived in obscurity, driven to conceal their unparalleled potential, which had grown to a level that threatened even the mightiest of contemporaneous forces.

            Among these clandestine survivors, it is said that Lie Thorne Xier emerged as the radiant beacon and guiding light for a new path. He, a singular figure touched by an ethereal wisdom, embraced the mantle of the founder and steered the course of the Sanctuary of Ascendancy.

            In its nascent days, the dynasty stood as a mere ember in a world cloaked in darkness. With scarce a handful of devoted adherents, Lie Thorne Xier encountered profound challenges, obstacles that tested his faith and resolve. The very foundations of his fledgling dynasty were threatened by persecution, doubt, and the relentless forces of the 'dark history.' It was during these trials that Lie Thorne Xier's resolve was hardened, and the core principles of the Sanctuary of Ascendancy took shape.

            The turning point came in the form of a profound revelation during a solitary meditation at a secluded mountain retreat. Lie Thorne Xier experienced a vision that spanned the ages, glimpsing into the very heart of the universe. In that transcendent moment, he received a divine calling to share his wisdom with the world. This ethereal encounter solidified his mission to lead his followers towards the path of enlightenment, a mission he could not deny.

            To this day, the legacy of Lie Thorne Xier endures within the Sanctuary of Ascendancy. His wisdom is enshrined in sacred texts, his meditations are practiced by devotees seeking to tap into the same ethereal insights, and his personal artifacts, such as a time-worn staff and an ancient robe, are revered relics of the faith. The cult's rituals and teachings bear the indelible mark of their founder, ensuring that his enlightenment lives on, guiding and inspiring all who seek the path to the realm of immortals.
